    abstract = {As robots and autonomous systems become more adept at handling complex scenarios, their underlying mechanisms also become increasingly complex and opaque. This lack of transparency can give rise to unverifiable behaviours, limiting the use of robots in a number of applications including high-stakes scenarios, e.g. self-driving cars or first responders. In this paper and accompanying video, we present a system that learns from demonstrations to inspect areas in a remote environment and to explain robot behaviour. Using semi-supervised learning, the robot is able to inspect an offshore platform autonomously, whilst explaining its decision process both through both image-based and natural language-based interfaces.},

    abstract = {Public perceptions of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) are important in the acceptance, uptake, government regulation and research funding of this technology. Recent research has shown that the public's understanding of RAI can be negative or inaccurate. We believe effective public engagement can help ensure that public opinion is better informed. In this paper, we describe our first iteration of a high throughput in-person public engagement activity. We describe the use of a light touch quiz-format survey instrument to integrate in-the-wild research participation into the engagement, allowing us to probe both the effectiveness of our engagement strategy, and public perceptions of the future roles of robots and humans working in dangerous settings, such as in the off-shore energy sector. We critique our methods and share interesting results into generational differences within the public's view of the future of Robotics and AI in hazardous environments. These findings include that older peoples' views about the future of robots in hazardous environments were not swayed by exposure to our exhibit, while the views of younger people were affected by our exhibit, leading us to consider carefully in future how to more effectively engage with and inform older people.},
